The following program is an image viewer that takes in PPM formatted files
and views the image as colored ASCII characters. This code will read in PPM
formats of both ASCII and binary type and read in the pixels. These pixels
will then be used to determine the luminosity and color to print out. The
result of this should display the image rendered as colored ASCII values.
but with the terminal, we are limited to how many pixels we can print within
a terminal. Downsizing is necessary in order to accommodate for the character
cap. Execution of the code should provide the PPM's header details, then the
image rendered.
